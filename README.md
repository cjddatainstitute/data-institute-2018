# Data Institute 2018
For students of https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/ida-propublica-data-institute

Here are all of the materials we used to teach the 2018 ProPublica Data Institute: slides, exercises, links, and homework. This is not an online course and doesnâ€™t have all the context or instruction to be a standalone class.
